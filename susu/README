Just a tip: create a "build" directory, "cd build" and "cmake ..", "make"
then it won't shitting around the source dir.


SingletonCallOnce: on GCC 4.6.1 std::call_once is not working.
           It is exiting with unknown error.

SingletonCallOnceBoost:
    just the same implementation as SingletonCallOnce, using boost::call_once
