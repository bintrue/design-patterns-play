Just a tip: create a "build" directory, "cd build" and "cmake ..", "make"
then it won't shitting around the source dir.


SingletonCallOnce: on GCC 4.6.1 std::call_once is not working.
           It is exiting with unknown error.

SingletonCallOnceBoost:
    similar implementation as SingletonCallOnce, using boost::call_once, and boost's unique_ptr. (it is not using any c++0x feat.)

TODO: Singleton that using c++0x feat (also unique_ptr), but call_once used from boost.
